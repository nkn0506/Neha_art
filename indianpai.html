                Indian Paintings:
            </h2>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2 class="blog-post-title">History of Indian Paintings</h2>

                <p>Indian painting has a very long tradition and history in Indian art, though because of the climatic
                    conditions very few early examples survive. The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings
                    of pre-historic times, such as the petroglyphs found in places like Bhimbetka rock shelters.Some of
                    the Stone Age rock paintings found among the Bhimbetka rock shelters are approximately 10,000 years
                    old.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>India's ancient Hindu and Buddhist literature has many mentions of palaces and other buildings
                    decorated with paintings, but the paintings of the Ajanta Caves are the most significant of the
                    few ones which survive.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>A new style was introduced with <b> Mughal painting</b>, representing a fusion of the Persian
                        miniature
                        with older Indian traditions, and from the 17th century its style was diffused across Indian
                        princely courts of all religions, each developing a local style.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Classification</h2>
                <p>Indian paintings can be broadly classified as <b>murals</b>,<b>miniatures</b> and <b>paintings on
                        cloth</b>. Murals are
                    large works executed on the walls of solid structures, as in the Ajanta Caves and the Kailashnath
                    temple.</p>
                <p>1. <b >Mural Paintings</b>-> Murals are large works executed on the walls of
                    solid structures, as in
                    the
                    Ajanta Caves and the Kailashnath temple.</p>
                <p>2. <b >Miniature paintings</b> -> are executed on a very small scale for
                    books or albums on perishable
                    material
                    such as paper and cloth</p>
                <p>Traces of murals, in fresco-like techniques, survive in a number of sites with Indian
                    rock-cut architecture, going back at least 2,000 years, but the 1st and 5th-century remains at the
                    Ajanta Caves are much the most significant.</p>
                <p>3. <b>Painting on Cloth</b>-> Paintings on cloth were often produced in a
                    more popular context, often
                    as folk art, used for example by travelling reciters of epic poetry, such as the Bhopas of Rajasthan
                    and Chitrakathi elsewhere, and bought as souvenirs of pilgrimages. </p>

                    <p>Ancient texts defined six important aspects of painting. These 'Six Limbs' have been translated
                        as follows:

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Rupabheda</b>-> The knowledge of appearances.</li>
                            <li><b>Pramanam</b> -> Correct perception, measure and structure.</li>
                            <li><b>Bhava</b>-> Action of feelings on forms.</li>
                            <li><b>Lavanya Yojanam </b>-> Infusion of grace, artistic representation.</li>
                            <li> <b>Sadrisyam</b> -> Similitude.</li>
                            <li> <b>Varnikabhanga</b>-> Artistic manner of using the brush and colours. (Tagore.)</li>
